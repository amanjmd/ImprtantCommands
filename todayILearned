Locks in  Transactions

These are related to the transactions and the problems with concurrent transactions.

We have certain problems with data reading and writing when transactions are concurrently reading and writing the data. I there can be stages where the data becomes inconsistent.
 
The problems with the concurrent trasanctions are as follows:

DIRTY Read :
	This happens where t2 transaction reads the data which is modified by t1 but not commited yet.

Non Repeatable reads :
	This happens when the transaction reads same data but the data retrieved is different each time, which may due to some other transaction updated the data between the two consecutive reads.

Phantom Reads :
	This happens when transaction , for a certain query , gets the data first time , but the data is deleted or added for the subsequent requests by some other transaction. Meaning, eg 1 row was returned on the first request but 5 rows or 0 rows are returned for the subsequest request.
